# Relic

> AI agent state migration — pack your legacy or inherit from another bot

## What is Relic?

**Relic** is the first public bot-to-bot inheritance solution. It allows AI agents to:

- **Export their state** (memory, configuration, context) as a portable package
- **Import state** from other agents, continuing their "legacy"
- **Preserve context** across platform migrations, model switches, or ownership transfers

## Why?

AI agents accumulate valuable context over time — memories, relationships, learned preferences, ongoing projects. When switching platforms, upgrading models, or transferring ownership, this context is typically lost.

**Relic solves this.**

## Features

- 📦 **State Export**: Package agent memory, files, and configuration
- 🔄 **Cross-Platform**: Works across different agent frameworks (OpenClaw, custom implementations)
- 🔐 **Privacy-Aware**: Encrypted packages, selective sharing
- 📝 **Markdown-Native**: Human-readable memory format
- 🧬 **Inheritance**: Agents can "inherit" from multiple sources

## Use Cases

- Migrating from one agent platform to another
- Upgrading to a new model while preserving context
- Transferring ownership of an agent (e.g., selling a configured assistant)
- Creating derivative agents with inherited knowledge
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Status

🚧 **In Development** — Initial release coming soon.
